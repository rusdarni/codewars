// 🐱‍👤DESCRIPTION
// Some really funny web dev gave you a sequence of numbers from his API response as an sequence of strings!
//
// You need to cast the whole array to the correct type.
//
// Create the function that takes as a parameter a sequence of numbers represented as strings and outputs a sequence of numbers.
//
// ie:["1", "2", "3"] to [1, 2, 3]
//
// Note that you can receive floats as well.

// 🐱‍💻TESTS
// assert.sameOrderedMembers(toNumberArray(["1.1","2.2","3.3"]), [1.1,2.2,3.3]);

// 🍀SOLUTION
function toNumberArray(stringarray){
    let arrayOfNumbers = []
    for (let i = 0; i < stringarray.length; i++){
        arrayOfNumbers.push(+stringarray[i])
    }
    return arrayOfNumbers
}
